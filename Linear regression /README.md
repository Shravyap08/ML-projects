# Linear Regression Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on demonstrating the application of Linear Regression to predict outcomes based on a given dataset. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook,  the fundamentals of Linear Regression are explored, including data preprocessing, model fitting, evaluation, and interpretation of results. The project serves as an educational tool for understanding how to implement and interpret Linear Regression models in a data science context.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to:

- Understand and apply Linear Regression to a practical dataset.
- Demonstrate the data preprocessing steps required for Linear Regression.
- Evaluate the performance of the model and interpret the results.

## Technologies Used

- **Pandas & NumPy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
